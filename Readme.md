# Range Minimum Query Problem
### Mihaicuta Iulia-Andreea-Naomi 324CA

## Structura Fisierelor
* generate_tests/ - the programs used to generate the 4 types of tests
* in/
    * test[1-16] wide range of values for the lengths of the queries
    * test[17-32] the length of each query being close to the size of the array
    * test[33-48] the length of each query being close 500
    * test[49-64] the length of each query being close 5
* out/ - the results of the tests
* times_of_algorithms - programs that measured test-taking time and the time stamps
* segment_tree.c - square_root.c - sparse_table.c - the sources
* Makefile

The first test is proposed for the competition.
